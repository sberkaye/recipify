# Recipify - Website to find food recipes easily

Live demo [here](https://reactrecipify.netlify.app/).

This is one of my portfolio projects to demonstrate my abilities in JS, React and web development in general.

You can search any recipe available in [themealdb.com](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) by their names. The site is completely responsive. 

Styling has been done with Material UI's useStyles hook and Material UI components have been used. Routing to different recipe pages are done with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) and [Formik](https://formik.org/) has been used to create the signup & login forms.

[Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) has been used to test components and redux actions and reducers, alongside [moxios](https://github.com/axios/moxios).
